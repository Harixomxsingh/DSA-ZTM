```js
// hash table
const user = {
  name: "shivam",
  age: 21,
  working: false,
  title: "Data Analayis",
};

console.log((user.last = "singh")); // o(1)
console.log(user.working); // o(1)
```

but in object the index value is not in order, so we can also use map or set rather then object, map or set in also data structure,

```js
const user = new map();
const people = new set();
```

## create own Hash table

yes i know that javascript has object, map, set that are hash table but let's build our own using class.

```js

```
